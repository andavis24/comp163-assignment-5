# COMP 163: Assignment 5 - Loop Mastery

## Overview
This project has three challenges to practice loops in Python:
1. **Collatz Conjecture** – using a while loop  
2. **Prime Number Checker** – using a for loop  
3. **Multiplication Table** – using nested loops  

---

## Challenge 1: Collatz Conjecture
- Input: a positive integer  
- Output: prints the sequence until it reaches 1, plus the step count  
- Loop Choice: **while loop** (we don’t know how many steps it will take)  
- Commit: `"Challenge 1: Collatz sequence - while loop for unknown iterations"`

---

## Challenge 2: Prime Number Checker
- Input: a positive integer greater than 1  
- Output: says if the number is prime or not, with explanation  
- Loop Choice: **for loop** (we test a known range from 2 to n-1)  
- Commit: `"Challenge 2: Prime checker - for loop for known range"`

---

## Challenge 3: Multiplication Table
- Input: none  
- Output: a formatted 10x10 multiplication grid  
- Loop Choice: **nested loops** (outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns)  
- Commit: `"Challenge 3: Multiplication grid - nested loops for 2D data"`

---

## Notes
- Each solution has comments explaining the logic.  
- AI was only used for **clarification and formatting help**, not writing the main algorithms.
